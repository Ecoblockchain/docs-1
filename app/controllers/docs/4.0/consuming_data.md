# Consuming data

The DataTank makes data available through a REST interface. This means that data extracted from a certain data structure is available through HTTP. Just as any other operation of functionality, the discovery document shows us where to go!


TODO ADD INFO TO DISCOVERY DOCUMENT

The discovery document shows that http://foo/info contains a document that has references to all available datasets.


TODO INSERT EXAMPLE OF INFO DOCUMENT

The uri's provide a fast way to check out the data note that no format is added and content negotiation is done.
