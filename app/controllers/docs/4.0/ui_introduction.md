# User interface - Managing datasets

The user interface of The DataTank is designed to make the admin's job a bit easier.

This user interface is reached on the uri api/admin (e.g. http://foo/api/admin, with http://foo being the root of the datatank).

In short, the user interface provides the following:

* create, update, delete and view definitions
* create, update, delete and view users and groups

The user interface provides enough documentation to be fully self-explanatory. Click the question mark in the user interface for help.
