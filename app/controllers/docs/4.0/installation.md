## System Requirements

The DataTank requires a server with

* Apache2 or Nginx
* mod rewrite enabled
* PHP 5.3+, preferbly 5.4
* Any database supported by [Laravel 4](http://four.laravel.com/docs/database)

If you're using aÂ <strong>Unix</strong> system, the easiest way to meet these requirements is to perform the following commands:

    $ apt-get install apache2 php5 mysql-server php5-dev php5-memcache memcached
    $ a2enmod rewrite

If you're using a <strong>Windows</strong> system, you'll have to download a web stack that holds the necessary requirements.
