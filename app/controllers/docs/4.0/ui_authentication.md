# User interface - Managing authentication

In the sections below we'll explain:

* [users](#users)
* [groups](#groups)

In our platform we use [sentry](https://cartalyst.com/manual/sentry) to provide an authentication layer on top of our API and dataset actions (e.g. viewing datasets, editing definitions, etc.). These can be managed by using the admin user interface. In the top right corner you can find a "Users" and "Groups" button, which respectively allow the admin (or whoever has the permissions) to manage (add, edit, view) the users and groups.

<a id="users"></a>
## Users


<a id="groups"></a>
## Groups
