# User interface

The user interface of The DataTank is designed to make the admin's job a bit easier.

## api/admin

The user interface can be reached on the uri `api/admin` (e.g. http://foo/api/admin, with http://foo being the root of the datatank).

In short, the user interface provides the following:

* Create, update, delete and view definitions
* Create, update, delete and view users and groups

**How does it work?**
The user interface provides enough documentation to be fully self-explanatory. Click the question mark <i class='fa fa-lg fa-question-circle'></i> in the user interface to start the help guide.
